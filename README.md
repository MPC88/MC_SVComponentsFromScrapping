Function  
========  
Scrapping now grants components.  
  
Green Items => Chance to grant Fine Components  
Blue Items => Chance to grant Superior Components  
Purple Items => Chance to grant Adronian Components  
Legendary Items => Chance to grant Ardonian Components + a equal sized stack of the above (50% chance for fine, 35% chance for superior, 15% chance for ardonian)  
  
The chance for components to drop is a percentage calculated as follows:  
% chance = 10 + half tech knowledge (including any buffs from crew etc.)  
There is an additional +10% chance granted if you have the Nano Boosters engineering skill.  
  
The quantity of components obtained depends on your chance and how well you roll, up to a maximum of a stack of 10 components (or 2 stacks of 10 from scrapped legendary items).  A higher chance of any at all will also mean a higher chance for larger stacks.  
  
A lot of iron is already obtained, so whites do not have any additional drops.
